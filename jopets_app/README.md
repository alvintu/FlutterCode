# Jopets

A Flutter project, based on Neopets

On basic implementation, Jopets needs:
- a user, but for simplicity's sake, there will be no user login/authentication.
- jopets to select from
- a way to earn currency (play games)
- a way to spend currency

[ ] First Tab - a place to feed your Jopet (and clothe it eventually)  
[ ] Second Tab - a place to earn currency  
[ ] Third Tab - a place to spend currency   
### Detailed  
[ ] First Tab (detailed) - Selectable Jopet with HP, personality attributes, and Hunger Status (that decays over time)  
[ ] Second Tab - A simple task/game that can help currency. Perhaps practice many different elements of Flutter with animations and gesture recognizers to obtain currency.  
[ ] Third Tab - a shopping cart that can be used to spend currency (in the original game, you can also haggle, but that's another feature)
